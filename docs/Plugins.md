# Plugins
Plugins make it easy to customize Trunk Recorder and have it better fit you workflow. There are some built-in Plugins that are included in Trunk Recorder and also ones that the Community has developed.

The [Built-in Plugins](#built-in-plugins) are compiled and installed when you setup Trunk Recorder. Follow the instructions for the [Community Plugins](#community-plugins) to install them. In order to load a plugin when you start Trunk Recorder, you need to add a **plugins** section to your **config.json** file. A [Plugin JSON Object](#plugin-object) is add for each of the Plugins you wish to load. The Plugin Object tells Trunk Recorder how to load it and its configuration.

```json
{
  Global Configs

  "sources": [{ Source Object }, { Source Object }],
  "systems": [{ System Object }, { System Object }],
  "plugins": [{ Plugin Object }]
}
```

##### simplestream Plugin

**Name:** simplestream
**Library:** libsimplestream.so

This plugin streams uncompressed audio (16 bit Int, 8 kHz, mono) to UDP or TCP ports in real time as it is being recorded by trunk-recorder.  It can be configured to stream audio from all talkgroups and systems being recorded or only specified talkgroups and systems.  TGID information can be prepended to the audio data to allow the receiving program to take action based on the TGID.  Audio from different Systems should be streamed to different UDP/TCP ports to prevent crosstalk and interleaved audio from talkgroups with the same TGID on different systems.

This plugin does not, by itself, stream audio to any online services.  Because it sends uncompressed PCM audio, it is not bandwidth efficient and is intended mostly to send audio to other programs running on the same computer as trunk-recorder or to other computers on the LAN.  The programs receiving PCM audio from this plugin may play it on speakers, compress it and stream it to an online service, etc.

**NOTE 1: In order for this plugin to work, the audioStreaming option in the Global Configs section (see above) must be set to true.**

**NOTE 2: trunk-recorder passes analog audio to this plugin at 16 kHz sample rate and digital audio at 8 kHz sample rate.  Since the audio data being streamed doesn't contain the sample rate, analog and digital audio should be configured to be sent to different ports to receivers that are matched to the same sample rate.**

| Key     | Required | Default Value | Type  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------- | :------: | ------------- | ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| streams |    ✓     |               | array | This is an array of objects, where each is an audio stream that will be sent to a specific IP address and UDP port. More information about what should be in each object is in the following table. |

*Audio Stream Object:*

| Key       | Required | Default Value | Type                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

This should match the shortName of a system that is defined in the main section of the config file.  When omitted, all Systems will be streamed to the address and port configured.  If TGIDs from Systems overlap, each system must be sent to a different port to prevent interleaved audio for talkgroups from different Systems with the same TGID. |
| useTCP    |          | false         | **true** / **false** | When set to true, TCP will be used instead of UDP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

###### Plugin Object Example #1:
This example will stream audio from talkgroup 58914 on system "CountyTrunked" to the local machine on UDP port 9123.
```yaml
        {
          "name":"simplestream",
          "library":"libsimplestream.so",
          "streams":[{
            "TGID":58914,
            "address":"127.0.0.1",
            "port":9123,
            "sendTGID":false,
            "shortName":"CountyTrunked"}
        }
```

###### Plugin Object Example #2:
This example will stream audio from talkgroup 58914 from System CountyTrunked to the local machine on UDP port 9123 and stream audio from talkgroup 58916 from System "StateTrunked" to the local machine on UDP port 9124.
```yaml
        {
          "name":"simplestream",
          "library":"libsimplestream.so",
          "streams":[{
            "TGID":58914,
            "address":"127.0.0.1",
            "port":9123,
            "sendTGID":false,
            "shortName":"CountyTrunked"},
           {"TGID":58916,
            "address":"127.0.0.1",
            "port":9124,
            "sendTGID":false,
            "shortName":"StateTrunked"}
          ]}
        }
```

###### Plugin Object Example #3:
This example will stream audio from talkgroups 58914 and 58916 from all Systems to the local machine on the same UDP port 9123.  It will prepend the TGID to the audio data in each UDP packet so that the receiving program can differentiate the two audio streams (the receiver may decide to only play one depending on priority, mix the two streams, play one left and one right, etc.)
```yaml
        {
          "name":"simplestream",
          "library":"libsimplestream.so",
          "streams":[{
            "TGID":58914,
            "address":"127.0.0.1",
            "port":9123,
            "sendTGID":true},
           {"TGID":58916,
            "address":"127.0.0.1",
            "port":9123,
            "sendTGID":true}
          ]}
        }
```
###### Plugin Object Example #4:
This example will stream audio from all talkgroups being recorded on System CountyTrunked to the local machine on UDP port 9123.  It will prepend the TGID to the audio data in each UDP packet so that the receiving program can decide which ones to play or otherwise handle)
```yaml
        {
          "name":"simplestream",
          "library":"libsimplestream.so",
          "streams":[{
            "TGID":0,
            "address":"127.0.0.1",
            "port":9123,
            "sendTGID":true,
            "shortName":"CountyTrunked"}
        }
```
##### Example - Sending Audio to pulseaudio
pulseaudio is the default sound system on many Linux computers, including the Raspberry Pi.  If configured to do so, pulseaudio can accept raw audio via TCP connection using the module-simple-protocol-tcp module.  Each TCP connection will show up as a different "application" in the pavucontrol volume mixer.

An example command to set up pulseaudio to receive 8 kHz digital audio from simplestream on TCP port 9125 (for 16 kHz analog audio, use `rate=16000`):
```
pacmd load-module module-simple-protocol-tcp sink=1 playback=true port=9125 format=s16le rate=8000 channels=1
```
The matching simplestream config to send audio from talkgroup 58918 to TCP port 9125 would then be something like this:
```yaml
        {
          "name":"simplestream",
          "library":"libsimplestream.so",
          "streams":[{
            "TGID":58918,
            "address":"127.0.0.1",
            "port":9125,
            "sendTGID":false,
            "shortName":"CountyTrunked",
            "useTCP":true}
        }
```

#### user_plugins
Plugins that are ready to clone into `/user_plugins` for automatic building and installation:
| Plugin Name / Link                                                     | Description                         |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| [Placeholder](https://github.com/tr_plugin_developer/my-tr-plugin.git) | Not a real plugin, but it could be. |

## Automatic Building and Development
As an alternative to developing out-of-tree, or within `/plugins`, user plugins may be staged into a subdirectory of `/user_plugins` to automatically compile as if they were a built-in plugin.  Minor changes may be required for exsting user plugins to benefit from automatic building, but this should simplify the process of development and installation, and ensure plugins remain up-to-date with any changes to Trunk Recorder.

#### Example
1. Clone the plugin repository
```bash
cd /user_plugins
git clone https://github.com/tr_plugin_developer/my-tr-plugin.git
```
&emsp; or add it as a submodule.  
```bash
cd /user_plugins
git submodule add https://github.com/tr_plugin_developer/my-tr-plugin.git
```

2. Review plugin requrements, and ensure all dependencies have been met.

3. Return to your 'build' directory, and resume from the `cmake` step: e.g.
```bash
cd trunk-build
cmake ../trunk-recorder
```
&emsp; Note that the plugin is displayed near the end of the cmake output:
```
-- Added user plugin: my-tr-plugin
```

4. Contine to build and install Trunk Recorder with included plugins:
```bash
make
sudo make install
```

Any of the built-in plugins in `/plugins` can be directly copied to `/user_plugins` as a template for development.  The `rdio_scanner` plugin is a good example of a curl-based uploader, and `stat_socket` shows how many of the internal Trunk Recorder methods can be accessed for live updates or offline analysis.  Ensure that instances of the previous plugin name are changed in `CMakeFile.txt` to avoid any conflicts with built-in plugins.
