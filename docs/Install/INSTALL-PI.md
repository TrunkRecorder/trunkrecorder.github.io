# Raspberry Pi / Debian

Smaller radio systems can be covered using a Raspberry Pi. If you are interested in doing this, you should really get a Pi 4. It maybe possible to get things running on an older Pi, but you often get unexpect behavior and errors. A Pi 4 can handle 3-4 simulatanious recordings. Make sure you have a good power supply. Also pay attention to heat. If the Pi gets too hot, it will slow down. A good case or fan can help keep it going full tilt. You can also just run debian on a NUC or Miniform PC. These commands will work with a vaneilla debian install as well.

## RaspberryOS (aka Raspbian)

### Setup Raspbian
This is a [good guide](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/raspberry-pi-headless-setup-how-to,6028.html) on how to setup a Raspberry Pi in headless mode. This means that you do not have to attach a monitor, keyboard or mouse to it to get it working. The steps below are pulled from this guide.

#### Download and burn the image

The first step is to put the Raspberry Pi OS onto a MicroSD card. You will need to have a USB MicroSD card adaptor, so you can connect it to your computer. Either of these approaches should work:

- Download the [Raspberry Pi OS Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/#raspberry-pi-os-64-bit) image.
- [Install Raspberry Pi OS using Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/) which can download and burn the image above.

#### Setup for headless boot

After the OS has been written to MicroSD card, we need to change a few files so that the Pi can get on Wifi and also allow for SSH connections. See the [guide](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/raspberry-pi-headless-setup-how-to,6028.html) for how to do it using Windows.

- **On a Mac** `touch /Volumes/boot/ssh`
- Next, add the WiFi info
    - `nano /Volumes/boot/wpa_supplicant.conf`

```
country=US
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
    ssid="NETWORK-NAME"
    psk="NETWORK-PASSWORD"
}
```
- Eject the MicroSD card (first in the OS and then physhically from the reader)
- Put the MicroSD card in the Pi and power it on.

#### Remote Access

This is a [good guide](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/computers/remote-access.html) for how to find and connect to a Pi on your network. 

*These steps should work on a Mac and assume you only have one Pi on the Network*
- Check to see if it is up: `ping raspberrypi.local`
- Clear old known hosts: `ssh-keygen -R raspberrypi.local`
- See if you can connect: `ssh pi@raspberrypi.local`  *default password is: **raspberry** *
- Exit: `exit`
- Create your SSH keys if you don't have them yet: `ssh-keygen`
- Send over you keys: `ssh-copy-id pi@raspberrypi.local`

### Setup

The following steps setup all of the libraries needed to build Trunk Recorder.

- Add the Debian Multimedia source and include non-free libraries, like **fdkaac**. Edit the sources.list file: 
```bash
sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
```
- and add this line to the end:
```
deb https://www.deb-multimedia.org bookworm main non-free
```
- Download the keys for the apt source and install them:
```bash
wget https://www.deb-multimedia.org/pool/main/d/deb-multimedia-keyring/deb-multimedia-keyring_2024.9.1_all.deb
sudo dpkg -i deb-multimedia-keyring_2024.9.1_all.deb
```
- You can verify the package integrity with:
```bash
sha256sum deb-multimedia-keyring_2024.9.1_all.deb
9faa6f6cba80aeb69c9bac139b74a3d61596d4486e2458c2c65efe9e21ff3c7d deb-multimedia-keyring_2024.9.1_all.deb
```
- Update the OS:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```
- Add all of the libraries needed:
```bash
sudo apt -y install libssl-dev openssl curl git fdkaac sox libcurl3-gnutls libcurl4 libcurl4-openssl-dev gnuradio gnuradio-dev gr-osmosdr libhackrf-dev libuhd-dev cmake make build-essential libboost-all-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev libsndfile1-dev
```

- Remove xtra-dkms.
DKMS is not needed on the Raspberry Pi platform, and just causes issues. The above command actually returns an error on Raspberry Pi OS. So we remove that module from our build so we do not get errors from subsaquent `apt` calls.
```bash
sudo apt remove xtrx-dkms
```

## Configure RTL-SDRs to load correctly:

```bash
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/osmocom/rtl-sdr/master/rtl-sdr.rules ~/rtl-sdr.rules
sudo mv ~/rtl-sdr.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/20.rtlsdr.rules
```

You will need to restart for the rules to take effect. Logging out and logging back in will not be enough.

```bash
sudo shutdown -r now
```

## Configuring the UHD for Ettus SDRs

If you haven't setup UHD yet there are a few extra steps you need to take:

Install the UHD drivers:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libuhd-dev uhd-host
```

Download the firmware images. The location of the downloader is different than the error message:

```bash
dpkg -L uhd-host | grep "downloader"
```
The run the downloader at the location identified, it should be something like this:

```bash
sudo python3 /usr/libexec/uhd/utils/uhd_images_downloader.py
```

Setup the udev rules so any user can access the USB, as documented [here](https://files.ettus.com/manual/page_transport.html#transport_usb_udev):

```bash
cd /usr/libexec/uhd/utils/
sudo cp uhd-usrp.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger
```

## Building Trunk Recorder

In order to keep your copy of the Trunk Recorder source code free of build artifacts created by the build process, it is suggested to create a separate "out-of-tree" build directory. We will use `trunk-build` as our build directory. We by default do this in our home directory (`~` - Is a shortcut back to home.).

**Note:** Depending on the ammount of RAM in your Raspberry Pi, it may be best to run `make -j1` (2GB), `make -j3` (4GB), and `make -j4` (8GB) in order to ensure that you do not run out of RAM, at the cost of making the compile process take longer. If you ran out of RAM the compile process will fail competely, so it can be an acceptable tradeoff.

```bash
cd ~
mkdir trunk-build
git clone https://github.com/robotastic/trunk-recorder.git
cd trunk-build
cmake ../trunk-recorder
make -j1
sudo make install
```

## Configuring Trunk Recorder

The next step is to [configure Trunk Recorder](../CONFIGURE.md) for the system you are trying to capture.

***
# Ubuntu 22.04 Server (64-bit support!)

Ubuntu has a very good [guide](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ubuntu-on-your-raspberry-pi#1-overview) on setting up Ubuntu Server to run on a Raspberry Pi. Follow this to get started.


```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

```bash
sudo apt install -y apt-transport-https build-essential ca-certificates fdkaac git gnupg gnuradio gnuradio-dev gr-osmosdr libboost-all-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libgmp-dev libhackrf-dev liborc-0.4-dev libpthread-stubs0-dev libssl-dev libuhd-dev libusb-dev pkg-config software-properties-common cmake sox libsndfile1-dev
```

If you are using a HackRF:

```bash
sudo apt install -y hackrf libhackrf-dev libhackrf0
```

Configure RTL-SDRs to load correctly:

```bash
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/osmocom/rtl-sdr/master/rtl-sdr.rules  /etc/udev/rules.d/20.rtlsdr.rules
```

# Building Trunk Recorder

In order to keep your copy of the Trunk Recorder source code free of build artifacts created by the build process, it is suggested to create a separate "out-of-tree" build directory. We will use `trunk-build` as our build directory.

Assuming you are in the desired directory to place both trunk-recorder and trunk-build folders to, perform the following...

```bash
cd ~
mkdir trunk-build
git clone https://github.com/robotastic/trunk-recorder.git
cd trunk-build
cmake ../trunk-recorder
make -j `nproc`
sudo make install
```
Note:  If the Pi hangs during the `make -j 'nproc'` command, try `make` instead (it may take longer but may also prevent locking up the Pi due to all processor cores being 100% in use)

## Profile
(It takes about 15 minutes for this section.)

Run the command `volk_profile` to ensure that [VOLK (Vector-Optimized Library of Kernels)](https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/Volk) uses the best [SIMD (Single instruction, multiple data)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD) architecture for your processor.

## Configuring Trunk Recorder

The next step is to [configure Trunk Recorder](CONFIGURE.md) for the system you are trying to capture.

## Running trunk recorder. 

If all goes well you should now have the executable named `trunk-recorder`, and created the `config.json` configuration file as described in the [Wiki](https://github.com/robotastic/trunk-recorder/wiki/Configuring-a-System) and [README](https://github.com/robotastic/trunk-recorder/blob/master/README.md#configure).

From your build directory (e.g. `trunk-build`) you can now run
`./trunk-recorder`

### Runtime options

Trunk Recorder will look for a *config.json* file in the same directory as it is being run in. You can point it to a different config file by using the *--config* argument on the command line, for example: `./trunk-recorder --config=examples/config-wmata-rtl.json`.
