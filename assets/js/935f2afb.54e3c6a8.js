Images are published frequently to  Docker Hub. The images have GNURadio 3.8 and all other required dependencies built into it, so it should be ready to go and be a much faster solution than compiling. Images have been built for amd64 (amd64 is used by all modern Intel and AMD CPUs) and most popular flavors of ARM.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Install/INSTALL-LINUX":{"id":"Install/INSTALL-LINUX","title":"Linux Installs","description":"This page covers installing Trunk Recorder on a Linux box.

If you are interested in doing this, you should really get a Pi 4 or better yet, a Pi 5. It maybe possible to get things running on an older Pi, but you often get unexpect behavior and errors. A Pi 4 can handle 3-4 simultaneous recordings. Make sure you have a good power supply. Also pay attention to heat. If the Pi gets too hot, it will slow down. A good case or fan can help keep it going full tilt.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"intro":{"id":"intro","title":"All About Trunk Recorder","description":"Sponsors","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"notes/CALL-HANDLING":{"id":"notes/CALL-HANDLING","title":"CALL-HANDLING","description":"Use Mermaid Live to edit the charts.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"notes/PLUGIN-SYSTEM":{"id":"notes/PLUGIN-SYSTEM","title":"Plugin System","description":"The plugin system is designed to allow third parties to integrate their own features without changing the core code of trunk-recorder, and allow for features to be updated independently of the trunk-recorder code base.

Prior to v5.0, conventional recorders are always \\"on\\" waiting for a signal to break squelch. With v5.0 you now have a Signal Detector per source. Its job is to look over the bandwidth for that source and perform an FFT. For each FFT bin that is over a power threshold, it will look for a Conventional Recorder that has similar frequencies. If there is a match, it will Enable the recorder in the Souce\'s Recorder Selector. The Recorder Selector is just a way to determine if a Recorder should receive samples from the Source. In your logs, look for something like [ 0 ] AnalogC\\tEnabled - Freq -63dBM (Threshold: -69dBM) if you see that, it means that the Signal Detector has turned on a conventional recorder.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
